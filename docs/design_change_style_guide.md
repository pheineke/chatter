# Design Change Style Guide

## 1. Channel Header & Search
- Move the search icon from next to the server name to the far right of the channel header.
- Clicking the search icon opens a modal overlay for searching.

## 2. Members Sidebar
- Members sidebar should extend from the very top to the bottom of the app window.
- Channel header should only span the channel area, not the full width.

## 3. Color Palette
- Update the color scheme, especially the primary "blurple" color (currently `#5865f2`).
- Consider a new accent color for brand elements and highlights.
- Review and adjust background, hover, and text colors for improved contrast and modern feel.

## 4. Server/DM Button Hover
- Remove the squircle (rounded square) effect on hover for server and DM buttons.
- Use a more subtle or flat hover effect.

## 5. Channel Icons
- Replace the hashtag icon for text channels with a new, distinct icon (to be provided).

## 6. Settings Layout
- Redesign the settings layout for better usability and visual clarity.
- Consider a sidebar or tabbed interface for settings sections.

## 7. User Control Center
- Redesign the user control center at the bottom left.
- Awaiting HTML example for implementation details.

## 8. Paper Elements
- Explore adding more "Paper"-style UI elements inspired by Android 5 (Material Design), such as cards, shadows, and layered surfaces.
